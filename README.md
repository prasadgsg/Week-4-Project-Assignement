# Week-4-Project-Assignement
CodeBook.md has all the information on the  variables. 

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps.
Before running the R code make sure the data is downloaded into your working directory.
The source data are from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones Here are the data for the project: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
The Five steps are as described below
	1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
	3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
	4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
	5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The output is stored in the file tidyData.txt
